            <p style="text-align:justify;">Our design process begins with the creation of low-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes. Wireframes provide a skeletal framework for the website, mapping out the layout, hierarchy, and flow of information. Interactive prototypes take this a step further, simulating the actual user journey and interactions.
             By utilizing these low-fidelity visualizations, we can identify and address potential usability issues early on. Our team closely analyzes every aspect of the user experience, from the initial touchpoint through to conversion or task completion. Whether defining site architecture, crafting user flows, or refining interface elements, our prototyping process empowers us to make data-driven design decisions that prioritize user needs.</p>
